Broadening my skill sets, I obtained a BS in Information Technology with a focus on Web and Mobile Programming. Upon graduation, I began my career as a front-end web developer at a marketing agency. This role provided me with an overarching view of the entire life cycle of a web application, an introduction to Ad Ops analytics, and sharpened my proficiency in HTML, CSS/SCSS, JavaScript/jQuery and PHP. Through these experiences, I fostered a passion to constantly seek further opportunities to expand my skill set and continue to grow as a professional."
